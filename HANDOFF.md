# HANDOFF — Reverie: The Game (rebuild)

State of the rebuild. Read `DESIGN.md` first, then `.rebuild/CONTRACTS.md`
(shared-sim signatures) and `.rebuild/CLIENT.md` (client contract). The master
brief is `PROMPT.md`. This document replaces the stage log of the prototype.

## Architecture pointers

- `DESIGN.md` — how the rebuilt code satisfies the brief: one city map, the
  player/world/snapshot shapes, controls → messages, content layout, art map,
  quality gates.
- `.rebuild/CONTRACTS.md` — exact exported names and signatures for every
  `src/sim/**` module. Modules were written against it in parallel.
- `.rebuild/CLIENT.md` — client files and the seam between scenes/net and HUD.
- `src/sim/{types,constants,map,protocol}.ts`, `src/sim/content/ids.ts` — fixed
  contracts. Persistent ids do not change once shipped.
- `server/src/index.ts` — the Durable Object shell (`ReverieWorld`, object name
  `city-v2`, keys `world:v2` / `player:v2:<token>`), `server/src/clock.ts` — the
  elapsed-time fixed-step clock.

## Done

- Shared sim contracts and the level file (`map.ts`: eight districts, gates with
  personal requirements, walls, patches, every POI / node / NPC / enemy position).
- Server: cookie sessions, same-origin check, hibernation restore, single-tab
  ownership (4001), checkpoint before broadcast, alarm-driven 20 Hz steps,
  stale-intent expiry, per-viewer `snapshotFor`, `/health`.
- Live scripts: `scripts/smoke-world.mjs` (protocol v2 session smoke),
  `scripts/smoke-campaign.mjs` (Movement I over the wire, guest lock, link 7777,
  going under), `scripts/render-check.mjs` (Chromium screenshots + frame pacing).
- Landing page in `site/` (the game only), README rewritten.
- Engine, content and client modules are landing from their own workflows;
  see the file list in `DESIGN.md` §1.

## Verified

- `npx vitest run server` — session harness (restore, persist-before-broadcast,
  unknown socket, intent expiry, takeover, junk packets, per-viewer snapshots),
  clock.
- `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.server.json` — Worker typecheck against the sim.
- The live scripts run against `npx wrangler dev --port 8788` with the client
  staged in `site/play/`. Record the results here when they pass on a deploy.

## Next

- Wallet login (EIP-6963 signature, never a seed) replacing the mock link;
  the cookie session stays as the guest identity.
- Per-zone Durable Objects (one per district or district group) with handoff at
  gates; the world summary and news shared through a coordinator.
- D1 for the writeback log (history, passings, claims) with additive migrations.
- Mainnet stays disarmed: no mint, no `$REVERIE` settlement, claims desk banks
  into `banked` only. Keep the fairness tests green.
- Content growth: more side quests (each changes a POI, an NPC schedule, a cult
  object or a House standing), more Winke per school.

## Rules

- The server owns every number. `damageFor` is a constant.
- Guests: Movement I only, lock at the going-under, no claims, no flags, no
  Winke, no Care / Clearing / Organs.
- Every earner ships a sink. No yield promises anywhere.
- This is a standalone game. Nothing but the game appears in code, copy, site,
  docs or asset names. Credits name only the game.
- Reuse the existing art in `public/assets/`; no new generation. No acid green
  in the world, no gold in the HUD. No Square Enix names or silhouettes.
- Never touch WALL STREET, Meltdown, METROPHAGE, Mafia or Solana Seas.
- Agents do not commit or push; the session owner handles git.
- Keep `npm run typecheck`, `npm test` and `npm run build` green before handing off.
